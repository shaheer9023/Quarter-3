# Terms/Parameters to Explain:

Here’s a simple explanation of the parameters:

---

### 1. **Messages**  
These are the conversations between you and the AI.  
- **User messages**: Your input or question.  
- **Assistant messages**: The AI’s response.  
- **System messages**: Instructions for how the AI should behave, e.g., "Reply formally."

---

### 2. **Model**  
This tells the system which AI version to use, like `Gemini Ultra` , `Gemini Pro` and `Gemini Nano`. Different models have different abilities, and you choose based on your needs.

---

### 3. **Max Completion Tokens**  
This sets a limit on how much text the AI can generate. For example, you can prevent the response from being too long by using this.

---

### 4. **n**  
This decides how many responses the AI gives for one query.  
- Example: If `n=2`, the AI will provide two different answers to your question.

---

### 5. **Stream**  
When turned on, the response comes in parts (like typing one word at a time). When off, the AI sends the full response all at once.

---

### 6. **Temperature**  
This controls how creative the AI is:  
- A low value (e.g., `0.2`) gives straight and predictable answers.  
- A high value (e.g., `0.8`) makes the answers more creative or random.

---

### 7. **Top_p**  
This is like a filter for how varied the answers can be.  
- A low value focuses on the most likely responses.  
- A high value allows more variety in answers.

---

### 8. **Tools**  
This lets the AI use extra features, like searching the web, running code, or using specific plugins to enhance its answers.
